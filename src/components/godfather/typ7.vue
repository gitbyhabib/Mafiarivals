                <h3>How to play</h3>
                <h5>
                  To be a part of Dynasty every player must sign up first after
                  that player will be able to enter into Dynasty.<br /><br />
                  *Level: Level shows the current stats of players which will be
                  increase by gaining experience. <br /><br />
                  *Exp: Experience is players achievements which will be
                  collected by doing missions and other game tasks. It shows how
                  many they have compared to how many they need to reach the
                  next level. <br /><br />
                  *Energy: Energy is players' stamina which will be used in
                  missions. A timer will appear next to players' energy when
                  it's not full showing how long until they earn more.<br /><br />
                  *Blood: Blood is the most important element for surviving in
                  the Dynasty which will be needed to keep a good number of
                  abilities for doing missions and to keep a healthy life. .
                  Earn blood by doing Missions and sometimes also through Fight.
                  A timer will appear next to it showing when their next payload
                  comes in.
                  <br /><br />
                  *Minions: Minions increase players' blood flow every hour.
                  They are absolutely essential to maintaining upkeep costs and
                  overall status. They may dominate minions by spending blood in
                  order for them to earn blood for them, or they may release
                  them if they no longer require their services. It's a good
                  idea to keep all their minions, though, seeing as they pay a
                  one-time fee for them and they'll continue to earn blood for
                  them every hourâ€”even when you're not playing. Progressively
                  better minions will be unlocked as they level up.<br />
